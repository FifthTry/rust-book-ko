But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a\\n\u003E value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why\\n\u003E you have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in\\n\u003E relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief\\n\u003E explanation in preparation.\\n\u003E\\n\u003E Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use\\n\u003E at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores\\n\u003E values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite\\n\u003E order. This is referred to as *last in, first out*. Think of a stack of\\n\u003E plates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when\\n\u003E you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from\\n\u003E the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called *pushing\\n\u003E onto the stack*, and removing data is called *popping off the stack*. All\\n\u003E data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown\\n\u003E size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap\\n\u003E instead.\\n\u003E\\n\u003E The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a\\n\u003E certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap\\n\u003E that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a *pointer*, which\\n\u003E is the address of that location. This process is called *allocating on the\\n\u003E heap* and is sometimes abbreviated as just *allocating*. Pushing values onto\\n\u003E the stack is not considered allocating. Because the pointer to the heap is a\\n\u003E known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want\\n\u003E the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a\\n\u003E restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and\\n\u003E the staff finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If\\n\u003E someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to\\n\u003E find you.\\n\u003E\\n\u003E Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the\\n\u003E allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is\\n\u003E always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap\\n\u003E requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space\\n\u003E to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next\\n\u003E allocation.\\n\u003E\\n\u003E Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because\\n\u003E you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster\\n\u003E if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server\\n\u003E at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get\\n\u003E all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an\\n\u003E order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and\\n\u003E then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a\\n\u003E processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other\\n\u003E data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the\\n\u003E heap). Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time.\\n\u003E\\n\u003E When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function\\n\u003E (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s\\n\u003E local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those\\n\u003E values get popped off the stack.\\n\u003E\\n\u003E Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,\\n\u003E minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused\\n\u003E data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership\\n\u003E addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the\\n\u003E stack and the heap very often, but knowing that the main purpose of ownership\\n\u003E is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it does.\"",

Because the pointer to the heap is a\\n\u003E known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want\\n\u003E the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a\\n\u003E restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and\\n\u003E the staff finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If\\n\u003E someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to\\n\u003E find you.\\n\u003E\\n\u003E Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the\\n\u003E allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is\\n\u003E always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap\\n\u003E requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space\\n\u003E to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next\\n\u003E allocation.\\n\u003E\\n\u003E Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because\\n\u003E you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster\\n\u003E if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server\\n\u003E at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get\\n\u003E all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an\\n\u003E order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and\\n\u003E then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a\\n\u003E processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other\\n\u003E data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the\\n\u003E heap). Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time.\\n\u003E\\n\u003E When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function\\n\u003E (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s\\n\u003E local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those\\n\u003E values get popped off the stack.\\n\u003E\\n\u003E Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,\\n\u003E minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused\\n\u003E data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership\\n\u003E addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the\\n\u003E stack and the heap very often, but knowing that the main purpose of ownership\\n\u003E is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it does.\"",

All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running.
Some languages have garbage collection that constantly looks for no-longer used
memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly
allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed
through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If
any of the rules are violated, the program won’t compile. None of the features
of ownership will slow down your program while it’s running.</p>

<h3>The Stack and the Heap</h3>
<p>Many programming languages don’t require you to think about the stack and the
heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a
value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why
you have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in
relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief
explanation in preparation.</p>
<p>Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use
at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores
values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite
order. This is referred to as <em>last in, first out</em>. Think of a stack of
plates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when
you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from
the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called <em>pushing
onto the stack</em>, and removing data is called <em>popping off the stack</em>. All
data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown
size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap
instead.</p>
<p>The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a
certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap
that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a <em>pointer</em>, which
is the address of that location. This process is called <em>allocating on the
heap</em> and is sometimes abbreviated as just <em>allocating</em>. Pushing values onto
the stack is not considered allocating. Because the pointer to the heap is a
known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want
the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a
restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and
the staff finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If
someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to
find you.</p>
<p>Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the
allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is
always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap
requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space
to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next
allocation.</p>
<p>Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because
you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster
if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server
at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get
all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an
order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and
then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a
processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other
data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the
heap). Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time.</p>
<p>When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function
(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s
local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those
values get popped off the stack.</p>
<p>Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,
minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused
data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership
addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the
stack and the heap very often, but knowing that the main purpose of ownership
is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it does.</p>

on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, and can be
quickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another

program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t suitable for every
situation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they’re
immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write
our code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For
these situations, Rust has a second string type, <code>String</code>. This type manages
data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that
is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a <code>String</code> from a string

anymore, and we don’t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC,
it’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and
call code to explicitly return it, just as we did to request it. Doing this
correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,
we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If
we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one <code>allocate</code> with
exactly one <code>free</code>.</p>

But Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a problem: when <code>s2</code> and <code>s1</code> go out of scope, they will both try to free the same memory. This is known as a <em>double free</em> error and is one of the memory safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.</div>

Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when <code>s1</code> goes out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use <code>s1</code> after <code>s2</code> is created; it won’t work:</div>

If a type implements the <code>Copy</code> trait, a variable is still valid after assignment to another variable. Rust won’t let us annotate a type with <code>Copy</code> if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the <code>Drop</code> trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to that type, we’ll get a compile-time error.

이때 러스트는 제 3의 방식을 택했습니다. ‘소유권(ownership)’ 이라는 시스템을 만들고,
컴파일러가 컴파일 중 검사할 여러 규칙을 정해 메모리를 관리하는 방식이죠.

<h3>스택, 힙 영역</h3>
<p>대부분의 프로그래밍 언어에서는
스택, 힙 영역을 주제로 고민할 필요가 많지 않습니다.
하지만 러스트 같은 시스템 프로그래밍 언어에서는
값을 스택에 저장하느냐 힙에 저장하느냐의 차이가
프로그램의 동작 및 프로그래머의 의사 결정에 훨씬 큰 영향을 미칩니다.
소유권과 스택, 힙을 엮은 설명은 후술해뒀기에 여기서는 각 영역에 대해서만 간략히 설명하겠습니다.</p>
<p>스택, 힙 둘 다 여러분이 작성한 프로그램이 런타임 중 이용할
메모리 영역이라는 공통점이 있지만 구조는 각각 다릅니다.
스택은 값이 들어온 순서대로 저장하고, 역순으로 제거합니다.
이를 <em>last in, fist out</em> 이라 하죠. 쌓여 있는 접시로 예를 들어 보겠습니다.
여러분이 접시 더미에 접시를 추가할 땐 접시 더미의 꼭대기에 쌓고, 반대로 접시를 꺼낼 땐
꼭대기에서 한 장 꺼낼 겁니다. 중간이나 맨 아래에 끼워 넣는 건 쉽지 않겠죠.
이런 식으로 접시 더미, 즉 스택에 데이터를 추가하는 행위를 <em>푸시(push)</em> 라고 하며,
반대로 스택에서 데이터를 제거하는 행위는 <em>팝(pop)</em> 이라 합니다.</p>
<p>스택에 저장되는 데이터는 모두 명확하고 크기가 정해져 있어야 합니다.
컴파일 타임에 크기를 알 수 없거나, 크기가 변경될 수 있는 데이터는
스택 대신 힙에 저장됩니다. 힙은 스택보다 복잡합니다.
데이터를 힙에 넣을때 먼저 저장할 공간이 있는지 운영체제한테 물어봅니다.
그럼 메모리 할당자는 커다란 힙 영역 안에서 어떤 빈 지점을 찾고,
이 지점은 사용 중이라고 표시한 뒤 해당 지점을 가리키는 <em>포인터(pointer)</em> 를 우리한테 반환합니다.
이 과정을 <em>힙 공간 할당(allocating on the heap)</em>, 줄여서 <em>할당(allocationg)</em> 이라 합니다
(스택에 값을 푸시하는 것은 할당이라 부르지 않습니다). 포인터는 크기가 정해져 있어
스택에 저장할 수 있으나, 포인터가 가르키는 실제 데이터를 사용하고자 할 때는
포인터를 참조해 해당 포인터가 가리키는 위치로 이동하는 과정을 거쳐야 합니다.</p>
<p>힙 구조는 레스토랑에서 자리에 앉는 과정으로 비교할 수 있습니다.
레스토랑에 입장하면, 직원에게 인원수를 알립니다.
그러면 직원은 인원수에 맞는 빈 테이블을 찾아 안내하겠죠.
이후에 온 일행이 우리 테이블을 찾을 땐 직원에게 물어 안내받을 겁니다.</p>
<p>스택 영역은 데이터에 접근하는 방식상 힙 영역보다 속도가 빠릅니다.
메모리 할당자가 새로운 데이터를 저장할 공간을 찾을 필요가 없이
항상 스택의 가장 위에 데이터를 저장하면 되기 때문이죠.
반면에 힙에 공간을 할당하는 작업은 좀 더 많은 작업을 요구하는데,
메모리 할당자가 데이터를 저장하기에 충분한 공간을 먼저 찾고
다음 할당을 위한 준비를 위해 예약을 수행해야 하기 때문입니다.</p>
<p>힙 영역은 포인터가 가리키는 곳을 찾아가는 과정으로 인해 느려집니다.
현대 프로세서는 메모리 내부를 이리저리 왔다 갔다 하는 작업이 적을수록 속도가 빨라지는데,
힙에 있는 데이터들은 서로 멀리 떨어져 있어 프로세서가 계속해서 돌아다녀야 하기 때문이죠.
앞서 예로 든 레스토랑을 다시 한번 생각해봅시다.
여러분이 웨이터라면, 다른 테이블로 이동하기 전에 지금 있는 테이블의 주문을 모두 다
받고 나서 이동하는 게 가장 효율적일 겁니다. 반대로 A 테이블에서 하나 주문받고,
B 테이블로 이동해서 하나 주문받고, 다시 A로, 다시 B로 이동해가며 주문받으면 훨씬 느려지겠죠.
프로세서도 마찬가지입니다. 힙 영역처럼 데이터가 서로 멀리 떨어져 있으면 작업이 느려지고,
반대로 스택 영역처럼 데이터가 서로 붙어있으면 작업이 빨라집니다.
이외에도, 큰 공간을 할당하는 작업도 힙 영역의 속도를 늦추는 요인입니다.</p>
<p>여러분이 함수를 호출하면,
호출한 함수에 넘겨준 값(값 중엔 힙 영역의 데이터를 가르키는 포인터도 있을 수 있습니다)과
해당 함수의 지역 변수들이 스택에 푸시됩니다.
그리고 이 데이터들은 함수가 종료될 때 pop 됩니다.</p>
<p>코드 어느 부분에서 힙의 어떤 데이터를 사용하는지 추적하고,
힙에서 중복되는 데이터를 최소화하고, 쓰지 않는 데이터를 힙에서 정리해
영역을 확보하는 등의 작업은 모두 소유권과 관련되어 있습니다.
반대로 말하면 여러분이 소유권을 한번 이해하고 나면 스택, 힙 영역으로
고민할 일이 줄어들 거란 뜻이지만, 소유권의 존재 이유가 힙 데이터의 관리라는
점을 알고 있으면 소유권의 동작 방식을 이해하는데에 도움이 됩니다.</p>

문자열 리터럴은 쓰기 편리하지만, 만능은 아닙니다.
그 이유는 문자열 리터럴이 불변성(immutable)을 지니기에 변경할 수 없다는 점과,
프로그램에 필요한 모든 문자열을 우리가 프로그래밍하는 시점에 알 수는 없다는 점 때문입니다.
사용자한테 문자열을 입력받아 저장하는 기능 등을
만들어야 하는 상황에선 문자열 리터럴을 사용할 수 없죠.
따라서 러스트는 또 다른 문자열 타입인 <code>String</code> 을 제공합니다.
이 타입은 힙에 할당되기 때문에, 컴파일 타임에 크기를 알 수 없는 텍스트도 저장할 수 있습니다.
<code>String</code> 타입은 다음과 같이 <code>from</code> 함수와 문자열 리터럴을 이용해 생성 가능합니다.</p>

    /*
        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
