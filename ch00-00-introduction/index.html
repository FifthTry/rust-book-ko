    "value": "\"In general, this book assumes that you’re reading it in sequence from front to\\nback. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier\\nchapters might not delve into details on a topic; we typically revisit the\\ntopic in a later chapter.\\n\\nYou’ll find two kinds of chapters in this book: concept chapters and project\\nchapters. In concept chapters, you’ll learn about an aspect of Rust. In project\\nchapters, we’ll build small programs together, applying what you’ve learned so\\nfar. Chapters 2, 12, and 20 are project chapters; the rest are concept chapters.\\n\\nChapter 1 explains how to install Rust, how to write a “Hello, world!” program,\\nand how to use Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build tool. Chapter 2 is a\\nhands-on introduction to the Rust language. Here we cover concepts at a high\\nlevel, and later chapters will provide additional detail. If you want to get\\nyour hands dirty right away, Chapter 2 is the place for that. At first, you\\nmight even want to skip Chapter 3, which covers Rust features similar to those\\nof other programming languages, and head straight to Chapter 4 to learn about\\nRust’s ownership system. However, if you’re a particularly meticulous learner\\nwho prefers to learn every detail before moving on to the next, you might want\\nto skip Chapter 2 and go straight to Chapter 3, returning to Chapter 2 when\\nyou’d like to work on a project applying the details you’ve learned.\\n\\nChapter 5 discusses structs and methods, and Chapter 6 covers enums, `match`\\nexpressions, and the `if let` control flow construct. You’ll use structs and\\nenums to make custom types in Rust.\\n\\nIn Chapter 7, you’ll learn about Rust’s module system and about privacy rules\\nfor organizing your code and its public Application Programming Interface\\n(API). Chapter 8 discusses some common collection data structures that the\\nstandard library provides, such as vectors, strings, and hash maps. Chapter 9\\nexplores Rust’s error-handling philosophy and techniques.\\n\\nChapter 10 digs into generics, traits, and lifetimes, which give you the power\\nto define code that applies to multiple types. Chapter 11 is all about testing,\\nwhich even with Rust’s safety guarantees is necessary to ensure your program’s\\nlogic is correct. In Chapter 12, we’ll build our own implementation of a subset\\nof functionality from the `grep` command line tool that searches for text\\nwithin files. For this, we’ll use many of the concepts we discussed in the\\nprevious chapters.\\n\\nChapter 13 explores closures and iterators: features of Rust that come from\\nfunctional programming languages. In Chapter 14, we’ll examine Cargo in more\\ndepth and talk about best practices for sharing your libraries with others.\\nChapter 15 discusses smart pointers that the standard library provides and the\\ntraits that enable their functionality.\\n\\nIn Chapter 16, we’ll walk through different models of concurrent programming\\nand talk about how Rust helps you to program in multiple threads fearlessly.\\nChapter 17 looks at how Rust idioms compare to object-oriented programming\\nprinciples you might be familiar with.\\n\\nChapter 18 is a reference on patterns and pattern matching, which are powerful\\nways of expressing ideas throughout Rust programs. Chapter 19 contains a\\nsmorgasbord of advanced topics of interest, including unsafe Rust, macros, and\\nmore about lifetimes, traits, types, functions, and closures.\\n\\nIn Chapter 20, we’ll complete a project in which we’ll implement a low-level\\nmultithreaded web server!\\n\\nFinally, some appendices contain useful information about the language in a\\nmore reference-like format. Appendix A covers Rust’s keywords, Appendix B\\ncovers Rust’s operators and symbols, Appendix C covers derivable traits\\nprovided by the standard library, Appendix D covers some useful development\\ntools, and Appendix E explains Rust editions.\\n\\nThere is no wrong way to read this book: if you want to skip ahead, go for it!\\nYou might have to jump back to earlier chapters if you experience any\\nconfusion.

The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software.
High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming
language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful
technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option
to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle
traditionally associated with such control.</p>

developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-level code
is prone to a variety of subtle bugs, which in most other languages can be
caught only through extensive testing and careful code review by experienced
developers. In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to
compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By working
alongside the compiler, the team can spend their time focusing on the program’s
logic rather than chasing down bugs.</p>

By speed, we
mean the speed of the programs that you can create with Rust and the speed at
which Rust lets you write them. The Rust compiler’s checks ensure stability
through feature additions and refactoring. This is in contrast to the brittle
legacy code in languages without these checks, which developers are often
afraid to modify. By striving for zero-cost abstractions, higher-level features
that compile to lower-level code as fast as code written manually, Rust

here are merely some of the biggest stakeholders. Overall, Rust’s greatest
ambition is to eliminate the trade-offs that programmers have accepted for
decades by providing safety <em>and</em> productivity, speed <em>and</em> ergonomics. Give
Rust a try and see if its choices work for you.</p>

chapters. In concept chapters, you’ll learn about an aspect of Rust. In project
chapters, we’ll build small programs together, applying what you’ve learned so
far. Chapters 2, 12, and 20 are project chapters; the rest are concept chapters.</p>

<p data-id="0,0,0,1,2,1,0,2:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>Chapter 1 explains how to install Rust, how to write a “Hello, world!” program,
and how to use Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build tool. Chapter 2 is a
hands-on introduction to the Rust language. Here we cover concepts at a high
level, and later chapters will provide additional detail. If you want to get
your hands dirty right away, Chapter 2 is the place for that. At first, you
might even want to skip Chapter 3, which covers Rust features similar to those
of other programming languages, and head straight to Chapter 4 to learn about
Rust’s ownership system. However, if you’re a particularly meticulous learner
who prefers to learn every detail before moving on to the next, you might want
to skip Chapter 2 and go straight to Chapter 3, returning to Chapter 2 when
you’d like to work on a project applying the details you’ve learned.</p>

expressions, and the <code>if let</code> control flow construct. You’ll use structs and
enums to make custom types in Rust.</p>

for organizing your code and its public Application Programming Interface
(API). Chapter 8 discusses some common collection data structures that the
standard library provides, such as vectors, strings, and hash maps. Chapter 9
explores Rust’s error-handling philosophy and techniques.</p>

to define code that applies to multiple types. Chapter 11 is all about testing,
which even with Rust’s safety guarantees is necessary to ensure your program’s
logic is correct. In Chapter 12, we’ll build our own implementation of a subset
of functionality from the <code>grep</code> command line tool that searches for text
within files. For this, we’ll use many of the concepts we discussed in the
previous chapters.</p>

functional programming languages. In Chapter 14, we’ll examine Cargo in more
depth and talk about best practices for sharing your libraries with others.
Chapter 15 discusses smart pointers that the standard library provides and the
traits that enable their functionality.</p>

and talk about how Rust helps you to program in multiple threads fearlessly.
Chapter 17 looks at how Rust idioms compare to object-oriented programming
principles you might be familiar with.</p>

ways of expressing ideas throughout Rust programs. Chapter 19 contains a
smorgasbord of advanced topics of interest, including unsafe Rust, macros, and
more about lifetimes, traits, types, functions, and closures.</p>

more reference-like format. Appendix A covers Rust’s keywords, Appendix B
covers Rust’s operators and symbols, Appendix C covers derivable traits
provided by the standard library, Appendix D covers some useful development
tools, and Appendix E explains Rust editions.</p>

error messages the compiler displays: these will guide you toward working code.
As such, we’ll provide many examples that don’t compile along with the error
message the compiler will show you in each situation. Know that if you enter
and run a random example, it may not compile! Make sure you read the
surrounding text to see whether the example you’re trying to run is meant to
error. Ferris will also help you distinguish code that isn’t meant to work:</p>

에러 메시지만 잘 읽어도 코드 속 오류를 고칠 수 있기 때문이죠.
따라서, 여러분이 에러 메시지를 읽는 실력을 자연스럽게 늘릴 수 있도록 컴파일되지
않는 예제 코드와 해당 예제서 발생하는 에러 메시지를 다양하게 보여드릴 겁니다.
그러니 눈에 보이는 아무 예제나 컴파일을 돌렸더니 에러가 나타나더라도,
일부러 에러가 나타나게 만든 예제일 수도 있으니 당황하지 마시고 해당 예제 주위의 글을 읽어보세요.
편의를 위해, 오작동하도록 만든 코드에는 Ferris 가 등장하니 구분하는 데 참고하셔도 좋습니다.</p>

    /*
        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
